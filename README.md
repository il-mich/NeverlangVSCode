## Neverlang VS Code README

Welcome to the Neverlang VS Code extension!

### What is provided

This extension gives some basic syntax highlighting, which as of today does not include embedded syntaxes for the languages
used in the implementation of the slices.

### "Installation"

Place this whole folder in your `~/.vscode/extensions` and restart VS Code.
